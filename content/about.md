Hey, I'm Andrés.

I'm a software engineer who cares a lot about three things: performance, reliability, and building tools that last. My strongest experience is in C++ systems and Java applications, especially in areas involving graphs, parallel computing, and discrete optimization.

Since 2021 I've been part of the team that develops studioSL, a reservoir simulation platform used globally in energy operations. My work focuses on turning engineering requirements into solid code, improving performance, enhancing usability, and keeping the platform stable through strong test coverage and constant code reviews.

Before that, I completed a Master's in Computer Science in Canada, where I also built an open-source C++ framework to massively parallelize branching algorithms. It was tested at scale in national supercomputing clusters, and introduced a load-balancing strategy that improved performance in distributed environments.

I have a Bachelor's in Engineering, which gave me that analytical mindset I still lean on today when designing systems and solving complex problems. I didn't land in software by accident, I went after it, and I've been writing high-performance code long enough to know that good optimization is never about tricks, it's about understanding the system deeply.

One of the projects I'm most proud of is [GemPBA](https://github.com/rapastranac/gempba), a C++ optimization library that continues to grow based on real community needs. I enjoy creating work that other people can actually use, improve, and build on.

I'm always open to connecting with people who like working on efficient systems, open-source ideas, or software that solves real problems.
